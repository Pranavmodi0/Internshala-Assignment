# Notes Android App

This project outlines the design and development of a simple note-taking application for Android devices. The app prioritizes a user-friendly and efficient experience, leveraging the following features:

## Single Activity with Fragments

- The app adheres to a single-activity structure for streamlined navigation.
- Fragments manage distinct views within the activity, such as login, note list, and individual note editing.

## Google Sign-In

- Upon launch, a login screen appears for users who haven't authenticated yet.
- Google Sign-In is implemented for secure user authentication.
- Shared preferences or SQLite are utilized to store and manage user login status locally.

## Note Management

- Once logged in, the app presents a complete list of the user's notes, eliminating previews for clarity and efficiency.
- A RecyclerView efficiently displays the list of notes, providing a smooth scrolling and loading experience for potentially large datasets.

## Note Creation, Editing, and Deletion

- A dedicated button facilitates the creation of new notes, allowing users to capture their thoughts and ideas promptly.
- Existing notes can be seamlessly edited, enabling users to modify or update their content as needed.
- A user-friendly deletion mechanism empowers users to remove notes that are no longer relevant or necessary.
